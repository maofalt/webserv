 * @brief Sets up epoll for managing socket events.

 * @return The epoll file descriptor on success, -1 on error.
 *
 * @details This method initializes an epoll instance for efficiently managing socket
 *          events. For each socket descriptor in the 'sock_listens' collection, it sets up
 *          an epoll event structure and registers the socket for read events. The method
 *          then adds each socket to the epoll instance. If successful, the epoll file
 *          descriptor is returned; otherwise, an error code is returned.
 * @pre The server's listening sockets should have been successfully initialized and stored
 *      in the 'sock_listens' collection.
 * @post The epoll instance will be set up to efficiently handle incoming socket events.
 * @usage This method is typically invoked within the server's setup routine, specifically
 *        after initializing the server's listening sockets. The returned epoll file
 *        descriptor is used for efficient event handling during the server's operation.
 * @note The epoll instance is a key component for efficiently managing multiple socket
 *       events. Errors during epoll creation or socket event registration are handled,
 *       and the method returns -1 to indicate failure.
